# Debugging

The ScaleNPU currently has minimal debugging mechanisms, as its design focused on operation without extensive diagnostic features. There are no dedicated debugging registers or interfaces in this version, and the debugging capabilities are limited to the standard Control and Status Registers (CSRs) that provide basic monitoring of operation status.

Future iterations of the ScaleNPU could incorporate additional CSRs specifically for debugging purposes, allowing for better diagnostics and greater visibility into internal states and operations to aid in troubleshooting and performance tuning.
